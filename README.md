# Logger

This is a simple key logger that captures keystrokes and saves them to a file. There I do have a plan to have the program be a more stealthy keylogger, but for now, it is a simple keylogger. Hopefully when i have more time, I will be able to add more features to it.

Even though this is a simple keylogger, it is still a dangerous tool. I doubt my program will ever be used but just in case, I will not be responsible for any damage that may occur from using this program. Use at your own risk.
